    "The core data set is obtained from the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. This data was aggregated on an hourly basis. The corresponding weather and seasonal information, extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com was then added to it.\n",

    "The purpose of the dataset was anomaly and event detection (see  Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, \"Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge\", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.). That is: to see when the data is non-typical and then to infer that some event or anomaly occured (for example, they find that 'weird' values for bike rental occur during Hurricane Sandy).\n"
